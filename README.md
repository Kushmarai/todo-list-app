# todo-list-app
To-Do List application demonstrating DOM manipulation and localStorage implementation.

# To-Do App
- A simple and clean To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- I created this project to practice DOM manipulation, events, and localStorage handling.
- 👉 Live Demo: https://kushmatodoapp.ccbp.tech

# Features:
- Add new tasks
- Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Stores tasks permanently using localStorage
- Simple, clean and responsive UI

# How It Works:
- When a task is added, it gets saved in browser localStorage
- Deleted tasks are also removed from storage
- Even after refreshing the page or closing the browser, your tasks remain saved

# Run Locally:
Clone the repository: 
```git clone <your-repo-link>```

- Open the project folder
- Double-click on index.html

# Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- LocalStorage API

# What I Learned:
- Handling button click and key events
- Dynamically updating DOM elements
- Saving & retrieving data from localStorage
- Building a simple UI from scratch
- Writing cleaner and structured JavaScript code

# Future Improvements:
- Add “Edit Task” option
- Add filter options (All / Completed / Pending)
- Add animations for adding/removing tasks
- Dark/Light mode theme

# About This Project:
This is one of my best projects as I’m learning web development.
I will keep improving this as I grow in my MERN stack journey.
